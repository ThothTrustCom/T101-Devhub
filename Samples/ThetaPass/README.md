# ThetaPass
Password Manager, OTP (Time and Hashed based) generator, QR code storage, personal organizer and notebook all-in-one secure personal organizer to be used while traveling or on the move.

The ThetaPass applet is used as a portable viewer / code generator and editing the records in the ThetaPass applet requires calls to the APDUs or a thick client which we will provide.

Current codebase can only hold 64 entry slots

### Use Cases
 * Store passwords and PINs
 * Store credit or debit card numbers and CVV
 * Store personal notes
 * Store personal organizer events
 * Store QR codes for events (door entry) or Bitcoin Addresses
 * Store and generate OTP codes on-the-fly

### Storage Encryption
 * Utilizes AES-256-CBC to encrypt content on data blocks with the AES-256 bit (Storage Encryption Key) not exportable from the applet.
 * IV is generated by hashing the applet's ECC Public Key and a record's Record ID for additional uniqueness.
 * SEK is created as a smart card key object protected by the smart card and generated via the RandomData.ALG_SECURE_RANDOM card's internal secure random generator.

### APDU Encryption
 * ECC-ECDH over NIST-P256R1 and AES-256-CBC-PKCS5 with HMAC-SHA256 for message authentication.

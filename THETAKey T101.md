## About THETAKey

The THETAKey smart card is a rechargeable and highly advanced JavaCard capable smart card with an embedded e-Ink display screen with a 
screen dimension of 256 pixels on the width and height.

A single mechanical power button and 12 touch capacitive buttons are also equipped with the THETAKey smart card to allow users to securely 
interact with the smart card without having their keystrokes being keylogged on a conventional keyboard and the embedded e-Ink screen to 
provide a much more trusted and secure display than a conventional computer screen monitor.

The THETAKey product aims to provide high levels of digital security for secure logic execution combined with much more secure and trusted 
user interactions in a single end-user programmable smart card which is unlike most advanced smart cards which requires the card's 
manufacturer involvement in customizing the card's firmware.

The THETAKey with its Open API, allows end users to simply utilize existing JavaCard programming language to create their own JavaCard 
applets or to re-use existing off-the-shelf JavaCard applets with minimal changes to existing JavaCard applet codebases to be able to 
fully utilize the security framework and capabilities provided by the THETAKey T101 OpenAPI to fully realize and utilize the THETAKey's 
smart card functionalities.
